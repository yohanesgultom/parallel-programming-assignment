This is the code that support the "Playing with OpenCL: Gaussian Blurring" tutorial at
http://blog.refu.co/?p=663

In order to properly compile and run it you should download the OpenCL SDK and link against the OpenCL library and headers.

Additionally you need to add the "include" directory to the compiler's include path

For your convenience there is a simple makefile included.

After compiling the usage of the program is pretty simple. The legal arguments you can pass to it are:
-h		Displays this help message
-i		The name of the input image for blurring
-g		The size of the gaussian kernel. Default is 3
-s		The sigma parameter of the gaussian. Default is 0.8
