# Parallel Programming Assignment

Experiments on parallel programming using MPI
* Problem 1: 
  * Matrix-vector multiplication: row-wise, column-wise, checkerboard decomposition algorithm
  * Square matrix multiplication: row-wise, Cannon, Fox, DNS algorithm
* Problem 2: 
  * Process Topologies: creation & access, Cannon algorithm
  * Dynamic Process Generation: dynamic row-wise matrix multiplication
* Problem 3: 
  * Conjugate Gradient Method
* Problem 4:
  * Molecular dynamic with AMBER
